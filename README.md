## What Have I Done:
I've made this face detection program using Python. I've used OpenCV and MediaPipe module for made this program.

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it's used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.


## Required Packages:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the FaceDetection.py file.
- You're done! Enjoy the face detection program.
